<h1> My Background </h1>
<p>The classes Iâ€™ve taken thus far have emphasized the importance of <b>interpersonal communication</b> and the effects that strong communication skills can have on consumers. Within the past three years, I have taken a variety of classes that focus on <b>business, psychology, computers, communication, and writing.</b> Within the communication classes, I have ample experience writing <b>press releases, human interest stories, speeches, creating podcasts, summarizing research, and creating visuals.</b> All of which I believe could benefit your company due to the diversity of pieces and my ability to adapt to different projects. My fundamental understanding of <b>psychology</b> helps further my communication skills because it allows me to better understand the human brain in order to employ the best strategies to propel the success of your company. </p>

<p>
I was lucky enough to be an intern at Kitchen Fresh Foods this past summer. This supplied me with a better understanding of office life and a sense of being a <b>team player</b>.Likewise, I have over <b>five years</b> of expertise in the service industry that has provided me with insights into the consumer world. I will happily join your team with a sense of <b>positivity</b> and <b>excitement</b> for growth.
